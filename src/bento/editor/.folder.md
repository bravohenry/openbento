# Folder: /src/bento/editor

1. **"Status"**: Editor UI layer, providing interface and interactions for edit mode, managing Widget creation, editing, and deletion operations. Includes responsive layout management, device detection, toolbar actions, and profile editing with conditional share button.
2. **"Logic"**: Manages edit state through EditorContext, provides responsive layout via EditorLayout (desktop: two-column with adaptive widths, mobile: single-column scrollable), detects devices via useDeviceDetection hook, provides action buttons via EditorToolbar (widget creation, conditional sharing on desktop, view mode toggle), provides edit overlay through WidgetEditOverlay, displays user information in ProfileSection with mobile share button. Supports desktop/mobile view modes with separate widget layouts and auto-switching based on breakpoints.
3. **"Constraints"**: All edit operations must go through EditorContext, direct modification of Widget state is prohibited, must support desktop/mobile view mode separation. Layout must respect MIN_CANVAS_WIDTH and MIN_PROFILE_WIDTH constants. Device detection must be used for responsive behavior.
