# Folder: /src/bento/widgets

1. **"Status"**: Implementation layer for specific card types, encapsulating business logic as reusable Widget components, each Widget corresponds to a card type. Includes platform detection and configuration registry for link widgets.
2. **"Logic"**: Receives configuration data, renders through BentoCard, implements specific business logic (such as link navigation with platform detection, image display, map embedding, text notes with inline editing, etc.). Registry provides platform detection from URLs and extracts metadata. TextWidget (note variant) and SectionTitleWidget support inline content editing via contentEditable in edit mode.
3. **"Constraints"**: All Widgets must be registered in the registry, must be built on BentoCard, direct DOM manipulation is prohibited. Platform detection must use registry patterns. Widgets with inline editing must handle contentEditable state synchronization and prevent widget selection when clicking on editable content.
