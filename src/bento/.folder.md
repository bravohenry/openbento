# Folder: /src/bento

1. **"Status"**: Core implementation layer of the Bento card system, providing card rendering, grid layout, drag-and-drop interactions, and editor functionality. This is the heart of OpenBento, where all user-visible card functionality resides.
2. **"Logic"**: Receives Widget configuration, renders through BentoCard, manages layout via BentoGrid, provides editing capabilities through Editor, and handles interactions via Dnd.
3. **"Constraints"**: All cards must be built on BentoCard, direct DOM manipulation is prohibited, state must be managed through Context.
