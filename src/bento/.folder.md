# Folder: /src/bento

1. **"Status"**: Core implementation layer of the Bento card system, providing card rendering, grid layout, drag-and-drop interactions, and editor functionality. This is the heart of OpenBento, where all user-visible card functionality resides. Includes desktop/mobile view mode support with separate widget layouts.
2. **"Logic"**: Receives Widget configuration, renders through BentoCard, manages layout via BentoGrid, provides editing capabilities through Editor (with two-column layout, toolbar, and profile editing), and handles interactions via Dnd. Widgets support platform detection for link widgets through registry.
3. **"Constraints"**: All cards must be built on BentoCard, direct DOM manipulation is prohibited, state must be managed through Context. Editor must support desktop/mobile view mode separation.
