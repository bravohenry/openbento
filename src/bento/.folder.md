# Folder: /src/bento

1. **"Status"**: Core implementation layer of the Bento card system, providing card rendering, grid layout, drag-and-drop interactions, and editor functionality. This is the heart of OpenBento, where all user-visible card functionality resides. Includes responsive desktop/mobile view mode support with separate widget layouts, device detection, and adaptive UI.
2. **"Logic"**: Receives Widget configuration, renders through BentoCard, manages layout via BentoGrid (responsive: 4 columns desktop, 2 columns mobile), provides editing capabilities through Editor (with responsive two-column desktop layout or single-column mobile layout, device-aware toolbar, and profile editing), and handles interactions via Dnd. Widgets support platform detection for link widgets through registry. Editor auto-switches between desktop/mobile layouts based on device detection and window size breakpoints.
3. **"Constraints"**: All cards must be built on BentoCard, direct DOM manipulation is prohibited, state must be managed through Context. Editor must support desktop/mobile view mode separation with responsive breakpoints. Layout must respect minimum width constants.
