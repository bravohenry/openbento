# Folder: /src/bento/core

1. **"Status"**: Atomic-level implementation of Bento cards, defining the visual structure, size system, and composition patterns. This is the foundation layer of the entire Bento system, and all other modules depend on it.
2. **"Logic"**: Provides BentoCard and its sub-components (Icon, Title, Subtitle, Image, Overlay, Action, Content) through Compound Component pattern, passes size and theme information through Context.
3. **"Constraints"**: All calculations must be idempotent, direct DOM manipulation is prohibited, must use size constants defined in BentoSizeMap.
