# Folder: /src

1. **"Status"**: Core source code directory. Contains all business logic, UI components, and design system. Each submodule has its own `.folder.md`, following the fractal documentation structure.
2. **"Logic"**: Organized by modules (app, bento, design-system, components, lib, stores, styles, types), with clear dependency flow from top-level modules to foundational utilities.
3. **"Constraints"**: All modules must follow naming conventions (index.ts for entry, *.types.ts for types, *.styles.ts for styles), must use TypeScript with strict checking.
