# Folder: /src/design-system

1. **"Status"**: OpenBento's design system, providing design tokens, atomic components, and composite component patterns, following Atomic Design principles.
2. **"Logic"**: Tokens → Foundation → Primitives → Patterns, built bottom-up, upper layers depend on lower layers, providing a unified visual language.
3. **"Constraints"**: All components must use design tokens, hard-coded colors and sizes are prohibited, must support theme switching.
